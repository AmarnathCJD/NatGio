They are often found along the coast, where they are called coastal plains. Plains can also be found inland, where they are called interior plains. Plains are sometimes called lowlands or lowland plains. The term lowlands is also used to refer to areas that are lower in elevation than nearby areas. For example, the Great Plains of the United States are lower in elevation than the Rocky Mountains to the west. The Great Plains are also lower in elevation than the Canadian Shield to the north and the Appalachian Mountains to the east.",

For example, the Black Hills of South Dakota are mountains that rise up from the surrounding plains. The Black Hills are also an example of an isolated mountain range. An isolated mountain range is a group of mountains that are not part of a larger mountain system. The Black Hills are not part of the Rocky Mountains, which lie to the west. The Black Hills are also not part of the Appalachian Mountains, which lie to the east. The Black Hills are part of the Great Plains, which lie to the east and north.

Plateaus are also different from plains, which are flat areas that have only small changes in elevation. Plateaus are often found near mountains and mountain ranges. They can be formed by processes such as continental drift and volcanic eruptions. Plateaus can also be formed when the land is uplifted by tectonic activity. Plateaus can be formed by lava flows. When lava flows out of a volcano, it can form a plateau. The lava spreads out over a wide area and cools. The lava can also form a plateau when it flows into a valley.
